    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My hobbies include programming, solving problems on platforms like LeetCode and Codewars, and building web
        applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also passionate about learning new programming languages,
        solving logic puzzles, and contributing to open-source projects. In my free time, I enjoy reading books on
        technology and personal development.</p>
